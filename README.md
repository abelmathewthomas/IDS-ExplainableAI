# IDS-ExplainableAI


Abstract

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a Network Intruder Detection System using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI). The system's primary goal is to enhance network security by identifying and mitigating potential intrusions effectively. Leveraging advanced AI techniques such as the Lime library, decision trees, and MLP classifier along with the powerful analytical environment provided by Jupyter Notebook, this project aims to deliver a robust and interpretable solution for network intrusion detection.

Objectives and Scope:

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. Developing a Network Intruder Detection System using Explainable AI techniques.
2. Integrating the Lime library for model interpretability and explainability.
3. Implementing decision trees, MLP classifier, for intrusion detection.
4. Creating a user-friendly interface using Jupyter Notebook for system monitoring and analysis.
5. Evaluating the system's performance in terms of detection accuracy, false positives, and explainability metrics.


Key Features and Functionalities:

The Network Intruder Detection System offers several key features and functionalities:

1. Explainable AI Integration: Utilizing the Lime library to provide human-understandable explanations for model predictions, enhancing transparency and trust in the detection system.
2. Multiple Model Approach: Leveraging decision trees, and  MLP classifier to capture different aspects of network behaviour and improve detection accuracy.
3. Real-time Monitoring: The system continuously monitors network traffic, analysing patterns and anomalies in real-time to detect potential intrusions promptly.
4. Alerting Mechanism: Implementing an alerting mechanism to notify administrators or security personnel when suspicious activities are detected, enabling swift response actions.
5. Scalability: Designing the system to be scalable, capable of handling large volumes of network data and adapting to evolving threat landscapes.
